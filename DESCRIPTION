Description: Provide functions to fit Conway-Maxwell-Poisson
    (COM-Poisson) models with varying dispersion in its original
    parametrization and in the mean-type parametrization proposed by
    Ribeiro Jr, et al. 2018 <arxiv.org/abs/1801.09795>. The functions to
    computate the normalizing constant are written in C++, so the
    computations is reasonably fast.
